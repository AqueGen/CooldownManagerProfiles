## Summary

Unlimited profiles for the Blizzard Cooldown Manager. Save, organize, and share your layouts across all characters — with templates, import/export, and auto-sync on login.

## Description (paste into CurseForge in Markdown mode)

Cooldown Manager Profiles adds a full profile and template system on top of the built-in Cooldown Manager. Never lose a layout again — back up, organize, and share across all your characters.

### The Problem

Blizzard's Cooldown Manager limits you to 5 layouts per character with no way to share them between characters, back them up, or organize them by class and spec.

<!-- TODO: Add 1-2 screenshots of the main window here -->

### Profiles

- Create account-wide profiles that store layouts organized by class
- Load any profile onto any character — the addon automatically applies the right layouts for your current class
- Automatically load your active profile on login (optional, account-wide setting)
- Works alongside the native Cooldown Manager — doesn't replace it

### Templates

- Save individual layouts into a reusable template library
- Templates are organized by class and spec
- Add any template to any profile

### Import & Export

- Share full profiles, per-class setups, or individual layouts as text strings
- Import raw Cooldown Manager strings directly
- Smart conflict resolution when importing into existing profiles

### Sync with Blizzard

- Capture your current in-game layouts into a profile with one click
- Push profile layouts back into the Cooldown Manager
- Non-destructive — your Blizzard layouts are never modified without your action

### Interface

- Three-column resizable window with inline rename and delete
- Minimap button — left-click to open, right-click for settings
- Slash commands for quick access: `/cm`, `/cm save`, `/cm load`, `/cm import`, `/cm export`

### Requirements

- World of Warcraft: The War Within (Retail 12.0.x)
- Blizzard Cooldown Manager (ships with the game)

### Preset Profiles

The addon includes built-in preset profiles from well-known content creators. If you are a content creator and would like your Cooldown Manager layouts included as a preset, open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/AqueGen/CooldownManagerProfiles/issues) and we'll add it to a future release.
